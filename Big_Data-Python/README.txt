Our programme implements all of the basic requirements and all of the extensions, except the last hard one. We provide just the jupyter notebook that we created to run our programme, which contains an introduction, all the code with comments and markdown cells, and a conclusion, including decisions we made and explanations of the implementations. 

As we have used multiple libraries, these will need to be installed and enabled properly for the jupyter notebook to run. 
These are:
	pandas
	matplotlib
	numpy
	operator
	texttable (table)
	mpl_toolkits.mplot3d (3d plots)
	ipywdigets (widgets)
	IPython.display
	tkinter (GUI)

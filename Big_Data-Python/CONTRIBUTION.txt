My group and I met multiple times at the start, after our Spring Break, and decided to implement the basic requirements for this project together. I was in charge of implementing the first and third basic requirements (to check the consistency of the data, creating a new file if needed, and plotting bar/pie charts). We then decided to split up the extensions, and would help each other if needed. In this part, I implemented the first 5 extensions, as seen in the order in which they are written on the requirements. These were to produce tables of the data, to perform queries using pandas and print out the results, to build 3d plots of the data, to use ipywidgets to display sliders and more so the user can make queries, and finally to use a GUI to display a map from which the user could select the region to display other data.
